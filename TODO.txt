Next:

+ ncurses: Select multiple lines
- editablediffmodel: create class and tests
- editablediffmodel: modified lines are returned when requested
- editablediffmodel: undo/redo works
- editablediffmodel: ismodified works
- editablediffmodel: can save modified files
- ncurses: Can copy from one side to the other *
- ncurses: Can see long lines at bottom? (not short lines)
- ncurses: Long lines at bottom are scrollable
- ncurses: Can edit lines
- ncurses: Can edit long lines because they wrap or scroll
- ncurses: Handle screen resizes - can crash it by making screen smaller
- git: create a script suitable for use as GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
- editablediffmodel: allow locking one or both files as non-writeable
- general: return the correct values as used by git?

    * All edits go in a queue of undoable changes in EditableDiffModel.
      The last savepoint is a pointer to somewhere in the queue.  When we
      ask the EditableDiffModel for lines, it gets the original DiffModel
      lines and applies the changes in order.  Any change that occurs after
      the savepoint makes the line be marked as changed (visible in UI).

Next:
- ncurses: some kind of solution for SHIFT-UP and DOWN?  (numeric keypad?)
- ncurses: Support different colour schemes: white-on-black, black-on-white, others?
- ncurses: Special characters to indicate the line continues to the left or right
- ncurses: Highlight added and removed parts of the line in a DIFFERENT row.

Big:

- Make scalable to big files.  DiffModel would only cache a certain number of lines,
  and call into the parser whenever it needed to get some other lines.

- Don't use unified diffs internally since they are not quite as reliable
  as context diffs?  (Because of +++ line problem.)

- Support "align manually" on diffs

Unimportant:

- ncurses: Show line number in status bar?
- ncurses: Allow moving the vertical divider
- ncurses: Allow specifying tab width
- unified diffs: Ignore lines that do not start with a space in unified diffs
- ncurses: Don't redraw whole screen when we are only scrolling one line
- unified diffs: Treat lines beginning +++ that are not hunk beginnings
  (i.e. don't match exactly the +++ file-name date-format regular
  expression) as + lines
- listview: write lines one by one instead of returning a string
- ncurses: redefine keys?

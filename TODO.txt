+ ncurses: Basic ncurses startup, exit
+ ncurses: Moveable cursor
+ ncurses: Can take a screenshot for testing
+ ncurses: Unit tests for existing functionality
+ ncurses: Scrolling when cursor is moved
+ ncurses: Support for PageUp, PageDown
+ ncurses: Don't redraw whole screen when we have only moved the cursor
- ncurses: Jump to next/prev difference
- ncurses: Select multiple lines
- ncurses: Can copy from one side to the other *
- ncurses: Can see long lines word-wrapped at bottom? (not short lines)
- ncurses: Can edit lines
- ncurses: Can scroll to the right to see long lines
- ncurses: Can edit long lines because they wrap
- ncurses: Help page
- ncurses: Handle screen resizes - can crash it by making screen smaller

    * All edits go in a queue of undoable changes in EditableDiffModel.
      The last savepoint is a pointer to somewhere in the queue.  When we
      ask the EditableDiffModel for lines, it gets the original DiffModel
      lines and applies the changes in order.  Any change that occurs after
      the savepoint makes the line be marked as changed (visible in UI).

Big:

- Make the parser able to accept a line-number range so we can handle
  big files.  DiffModel would only cache a certain number of lines, and call
  into the parser whenever it needed to get some other lines.

- Don't use unified diffs internally since they are not quite as reliable
  as context diffs?  (Because of +++ line problem.)

Unimportant:

- unified diffs: Ignore lines that do not start with a space in unified diffs
- ncurses: Don't redraw whole screen when we are only scrolling one line
- unified diffs: Treat lines beginning +++ that are not hunk beginnings
  (i.e. don't match exactly the +++ file-name date-format regular
  expression) as + lines
- listview: write lines one by one instead of returning a string

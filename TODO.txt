Next:

- Write tests comparing the output if ListView with diff --side-by-side
- Modify ListView to match diff's side-by-side format
- Ignore lines that do not start with a space in unified diffs

Big:

- Make the parser able to accept a line-number range so we can handle
  big files.  DiffModel would only cache a certain number of lines, and call
  into the parser whenever it needed to get some other lines.

Unimportant:

- Treat lines beginning +++ that are not hunk beginnings (i.e. don't match
  exactly the +++ file-name date-format regular expression) as + lines
- Make ListView write lines one by one instead of returning a string

Next:

- Ignore lines that do not start with a space in unified diffs
- Basic ncurses interface:
 - Title line showing pretty names
 - Side-by side differences with dividing column
 - Status line saying "Press h for help"
- Moveable cursor
- Scrolling when cursor is moved
- Can copy from one side to the other
- Help page
- Can see long lines word-wrapped at bottom? (not short lines)
- Can edit lines
- Can scroll to the right to see long lines
- Can edit long lines because they wrap

Big:

- Make the parser able to accept a line-number range so we can handle
  big files.  DiffModel would only cache a certain number of lines, and call
  into the parser whenever it needed to get some other lines.

Unimportant:

- Treat lines beginning +++ that are not hunk beginnings (i.e. don't match
  exactly the +++ file-name date-format regular expression) as + lines
- Make ListView write lines one by one instead of returning a string

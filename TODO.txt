- filemanager: handle save failed e.g. file is not writeable

Big:

- general: Allow supplying a diff on stdin.  This might mean we can work as a
  GIT_PAGER?  To be really great, we would need to find the filenames in the
  supplied diff (git-style and normal) and look for those files, and use them
  to provide context if they exist.  If they don't exist, use whatever context
  is in the file, and show "... skip x lines ..." for any gaps.
  We would also need to handle multi-file diffs.  Showing all files as one
  side-by-side diff could potentially make us a much better complement to git?

- Create a scalability test case
- Make scalable to big files.  DiffModel would only cache a certain number of
  lines, and call into the parser whenever it needed to get some other lines.
  Preferably, we should call the underlying diff program and send its output
  to a fifo, so it's ready if/when we need it.

- Make scalable to long lines?

- Make scalable to large numbers of edits/undos?

- Don't use unified diffs internally since they are not quite as reliable
  as context diffs?  (Because of +++ line problem.)

- Support "align manually" on diffs

- ncurses: allow free editing rather than one line at a time?

- GTK interface

Later/Never:

- If you edit a line and don't actually change it (but other parts of
  your edit do change things) don't mark the unchanged line as changed.
  See test_editabkediffmodel.py:edit_doesnt_change_line.
- editablediffmodel: Cache results instead of recalculating each time?
- git: highlight whitespace at end of lines, and other git diffisms
- ncurses: toggle showing line number
- ncurses: Support different colour schemes: white-on-black, black-on-white?
- ncurses: Allow specifying tab width
- unified diffs: Ignore lines that do not start with a space in unified diffs
- ncurses: Don't redraw whole screen when we are only scrolling one line
- unified diffs: Treat lines beginning +++ that are not hunk beginnings
  (i.e. don't match exactly the +++ file-name date-format regular
  expression) as + lines
- listview: write lines one by one instead of returning a string
- ncurses: redefine keys?
- ncurses: pressing s saves the modified file wherever your cursor is?

- Refactor unified diff parsing into a separate class
- Write unit tests for remaining DiffModel functionality
- Remove 2nd file from test_unifieddiffparser
- Write tests comparing the output if ListView with diff --side-by-side
- Modify ListView to match diff's side-by-side format
- Ignore lines that do not start with a space in unified diffs

Later:

- Make the parser able to accept a line-number range so we can handle
  big files.  DiffModel would only cache a certain number of lines, and call
  into the parser whenever it needed to get some other lines.
